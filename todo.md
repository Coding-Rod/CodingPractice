## Month 1: React Development

### Week 1-2: Introduction to React
- **Understand React fundamentals:**
  - **Components, JSX syntax, and the virtual DOM:**  
    React components are the building blocks of React applications. JSX syntax allows you to write HTML-like code within JavaScript. The virtual DOM is a lightweight representation of the actual DOM, allowing React to efficiently update the UI.
    ```jsx
    // Example of a React component using JSX syntax
    function App() {
      return <h1>Hello, World!</h1>;
    }
    ```
  - **State and props:**  
    State represents the data that a component manages internally, while props are used to pass data from parent to child components.
    ```jsx
    // Example of a React component using state and props
    function Greeting(props) {
      return <h1>Hello, {props.name}!</h1>;
    }
    ```
  - **Component lifecycle methods:**  
    Lifecycle methods allow you to hook into different stages of a component's lifecycle, such as mounting, updating, and unmounting.
    ```jsx
    // Example of using lifecycle methods in a React component
    class Timer extends React.Component {
      componentDidMount() {
        this.timerID = setInterval(() => this.tick(), 1000);
      }

      componentWillUnmount() {
        clearInterval(this.timerID);
      }

      render() {
        return <div>Timer: {this.state.seconds}</div>;
      }
    }
    ```
- **Practice building simple React applications:**
  - **Create components for different UI elements:**  
    Break down your UI into reusable components for better organization and maintainability.
  - **Manage component state and props:**  
    Use state to manage component data and props to pass data between components.
  - **Handle user events and update UI accordingly:**  
    Use event handlers like onClick or onChange to respond to user interactions and update component state accordingly.
- **Explore React development tools:**
  - **Install and use React DevTools for debugging:**  
    React DevTools is a browser extension that allows you to inspect React component hierarchies, view component props and state, and track component updates.
  - **Learn about React developer workflows:**  
    Tools like create-react-app provide a pre-configured setup for building React applications, including features like hot reloading, code splitting, and production optimization.

### Week 3-4: Advanced React Concepts and Projects
- **Deepen understanding of advanced React concepts:**
  - **Hooks (useState, useEffect, useContext, etc.):**  
    React hooks are functions that allow you to use state and other React features in functional components.
    ```jsx
    // Example of using useState and useEffect hooks
    import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

    function Timer() {
      const [seconds, setSeconds] = useState(0);

      useEffect(() => {
        const interval = setInterval(() => {
          setSeconds(prevSeconds => prevSeconds + 1);
        }, 1000);
        return () => clearInterval(interval);
      }, []);

      return <div>Timer: {seconds}</div>;
    }
    ```
  - **Context API for managing global state:**  
    React Context API allows you to share data across the component tree without having to pass props manually at every level.
    ```jsx
    // Example of using React Context API
    import React, { createContext, useContext } from 'react';

    const ThemeContext = createContext('light');

    function App() {
      return (
        <ThemeContext.Provider value="dark">
          <Toolbar />
        </ThemeContext.Provider>
      );
    }

    function Toolbar() {
      const theme = useContext(ThemeContext);
      return <div>Current theme: {theme}</div>;
    }
    ```
  - **React Router for handling navigation:**  
    React Router is a popular library for adding routing capabilities to React applications.
    ```jsx
    // Example of using React Router for navigation
    import { BrowserRouter as Router, Route, Link } from 'react-router-dom';

    function App() {
      return (
        <Router>
          <div>
            <nav>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <Link to="/">Home</Link>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <Link to="/about">About</Link>
                </li>
              </ul>
            </nav>

            <Route path="/" exact component={Home} />
            <Route path="/about" component={About} />
          </div>
        </Router>
      );
    }
    ```

- **Build complex React applications:**
  - **Integrate state management libraries like Redux or React Context API:**  
    Use Redux or Context API to manage complex state that needs to be shared across multiple components.
  - **Implement authentication and user authentication flows:**  
    Add authentication features such as login, registration, and protected routes to your applications.
  - **Fetch and display data from backend APIs:**  
    Use libraries like Axios or fetch to make HTTP requests to backend APIs and display fetched data in your React components.
  - **Style applications using UI frameworks like Material-UI or Bootstrap:**  
    Use UI frameworks to quickly style your applications and create responsive, visually appealing user interfaces.
